**** Current problem ****
	- Geofire cant be used, not being initialized properly


Bite size decision:
	- Displaying parking spots on the map
	- Displaying parking queries in constant feed or in pages

Priority:
- Add user information edit
- Email confirmation upon registration
 	- verification not sent to majed.jendi@gmail.com
 	- Even after verification it doesnt allow me to sign in
 		- Check the verification field in the user vs printing whats actually being returned
- Ability to add photoes after registration


- ADD: only the user related to these orders specific orders can access them
- Learn to add the availability to users
- Learn how to incroprate the Venmo API
- Plaid to link to the bank account
- should add PayPal maybe as an option to receive payments


Problems to be solved:
1- handling non existent routes to the website
2- Add phone number validation (+1 206-.. etc)
3- Signup compnonent shouldnt show red stuff when the page opens as first
4- After failing to login the submit button should work again without having to
	refresh the page
5- The signup button should all have a consistant color and
   should all be clickable
6- Verification email is sometimes sent to the promotions section
7- Logging in right after signup shows that the user doesnt exist, probably need
	to refresh the page or something
8- Is there a cleaner way of not having that many catch blocks in signup?
9- Need to check which routes need to be directly connected, like emailSignUp page etc.
   
6- How to print the res error, the message assigned in the backend?
7- How to make the progress bar disapear at the beginning and they show up, disapearing at the end is figured out
8- Make the the name of the file apear on the box it self as well
9- Once a click is done, a loading image needs to be placed


Questions to Sami:
	Host registration
		- Any comments on it?
	Technical:
		- Should I allow to users to signup with the same phone numbers?
		- Should I trust the firebase hashing?
